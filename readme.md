# Ghost Party

Ghost Party is a board game played with 2 to 8 players.  The object of the game is to not be captured by the ghost and sent to the basement.

## Rules
Start of the round:
* Each player takes turns placing their characters within the hallway
* Once all the characters have been placed the game moves into the next phase

Ghost is still in the basement:
* Each player takes turn rolling the dice
* The dice results in a move of 1,2,3,4,5 or a Ghost
* If a number is rolled the character must move within the hallway (they are not allowed to move into a room until the Ghost is in the hallway)
  * Move a character by clicking where it would end up
* If a Ghost is rolled, the Ghost moves 3 spaces
* Each character take a turn rolling until the Ghost enters the hallway

Ghost is in the hallway:
* Similar to the previous phase characters take turn rolling the dice and moving
* Now that the Ghost is in the hallway, you can move into a room to avoid being captured by the Ghost
  * Rooms have three values: positive, negative, or neutral
  * Rooms that have positive values have to have exact rolls to enter
* The round ends when all the characters are either safely in a room or have been sent to the basement
* The game is played in three rounds
